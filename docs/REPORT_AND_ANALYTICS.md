# Report & Analytics — Full Documentation

> **Lesson:** Think Before You Spend (Lesson 1, Module 1).
> **Audience:** LMS integration team (engineering + product) and the Lean Hyphen platform team.
> **Owner:** info@leanhyphen.com.

This is the single source of truth for everything the platform records, computes, and exposes about a learner's lesson session — the data model, the scoring math, the badge rules, the report shape, and the API endpoints an LMS can read.

If you're integrating an LMS dashboard, the only sections you strictly need are §2, §6, §7, §8, §10, §11, §13. Everything else is for deeper context.

> **Identity model in one paragraph:** a *student* has a stable `learnerId` you pass at iframe launch (`?learnerId=…`). Each *play* of the lesson by that student is a new *session* with its own `attemptNo`. The report endpoints show the **latest** session by default. The new `/sessions` endpoint lists every session that student ever had on this lesson — use it for session history, growth charts, leaderboards.

> **Integration pattern: pull, not push.** Every metric lives behind a read endpoint (§10). The LMS *polls* what it needs. There are **no webhooks today** — we deliberately kept the contract one-way until a customer specifically asks for sub-second push (live class teacher views, real-time gradebook sync). For parent reports and daily dashboards, polling once on lesson-end plus every ~30 s while the learner is active delivers identical UX. See §12 for the exact polling recipe and §16 for the "if you really need push" plan.

## 1. Overview & 5-minute quickstart

The platform records every meaningful learner interaction as an event, materialises the rolled-up score/badges/report on each event, and exposes the result through a handful of read endpoints. An LMS reads those endpoints to display student progress and parent reports.

**Base URLs**

- Production API: `https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app`
- Production app: `https://frontend-think-before-you-spend.vercel.app`
- LMS will move to `https://api.leanhyphen.com` before public launch.

**Try the full pipeline in 5 minutes:**

1. Decide a learner id. Recommendation: `lms-<tenant>-<your-student-id>`. Example: `lms-canvas-stu-42`.
2. Open the lesson with that id:
   ```
   https://frontend-think-before-you-spend.vercel.app/?learnerId=lms-test-001
   ```
3. Play through Act 1 (~4 min) — events post to the backend in the background.
4. From your server (or curl), fetch the live report:
   ```bash
   curl 'https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app/api/analytics/lms-export/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=lms-test-001'
   ```
5. You'll get a JSON payload with score, badges, per-act breakdown — render it on your dashboard.

That's it. Everything else in this doc is "here's what each field means and when to call which endpoint".

                       /api/analytics/lesson/:id      ◄── student live view
                       /api/analytics/act/:id         ◄── per-act drill-down
                       /api/analytics/attempts/:id    ◄── attempt history
                       /api/analytics/lms-export/:id  ◄── stable parent report
```

**Design principles**

- **Event-sourced.** Every learner action lands in `analytics_events` as an immutable row. Aggregates are *derived*, so we can re-compute history after a config change or a bug fix.
- **Idempotent ingestion.** Every event carries a client-generated UUID. Retries from a flaky network can't double-count.
- **Anonymous-first.** Everything keys on `sessionId` (a UUID persisted in `localStorage`). When OTP auth lands later, a one-shot migration binds existing `session_id` values to `user_id`. Schema stays the same.
- **LMS-ready out of the box.** The `/lms-export` endpoint returns a stable JSON shape (schema `1.0`). Top-level keys won't break across releases.
- **Pull-based.** No webhooks today. You poll our read endpoints when you need fresh data. Caches are warm and reads are O(1).

---

## 3. Multi-student identity (the launch handshake)

Every student in your LMS has a stable id (`canvas_user_id`, `lms_user_id`, whatever you call it). When you launch our lesson in an iframe, pass that as the `learnerId` query param:

```
https://frontend-think-before-you-spend.vercel.app/?learnerId=lms-<tenant>-<your-student-id>
```

Examples:

- `lms-canvas-stu-42`
- `lms-moodle-7b3c-9a1d`
- `lms-school-acme-grade8-aarav`

Our frontend reads `?learnerId=` on load and uses it as the canonical session id for the whole session. From that moment:

- All learner events (`scene_entered`, `activity_completed`, …) are stamped with the same `learnerId`.
- All per-student API reads take that same `learnerId` as `sessionId`.
- Re-attempts append to the learner's history. We never overwrite.

**Critical rule:** `learnerId` must be stable **per student** across attempts and devices. If you change it between two attempts, the backend treats them as two different learners (separate score, separate history).

**Recommended naming:** `lms-<tenant>-<your-student-id>`. The `lms-` prefix is what lets us (a) later authenticate against your tenant and (b) distinguish LMS-owned sessions from anonymous public ones server-side.

---

## 4. Event taxonomy

Every meaningful interaction lands in `analytics_events` with a `kind` from this enum. Source of truth: [`backend/src/analytics/events.js`](../backend/src/analytics/events.js).

### Lifecycle

| `kind` | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `lesson_started` | Learner enters the first Act of the lesson |
| `lesson_completed` | Last Act finished, all activities done |
| `lesson_abandoned` | Learner navigated away mid-lesson (not yet fully enforced) |
| `act_started` | Each Act mount |
| `act_completed` | Each Act's final phase reached |
| `scene_entered` | Each scene boundary entered |
| `scene_completed` | Each scene's last phase reached |
| `scene_skipped` | Learner used a skip control inside the scene |

### Activity lifecycle

| `kind` | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `activity_started` | An interactive activity (drag game, MCQ, simulation) starts |
| `activity_completed` | Successful or unsuccessful end of an activity attempt |
| `activity_retried` | Learner restarted an activity after a wrong answer |
| `activity_failed` | Backend-determined failure (didn't meet threshold) |
| `activity_passed` | Backend-determined success |

### Interactions

| `kind` | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `drag_drop_completed` | A drag-drop activity finished |
| `mcq_answered` | A multiple-choice question answered |
| `option_selected` | A radio / select option chosen |
| `hint_opened` | Learner opened a hint |
| `reflection_submitted` | Free-text reflection submitted |
| `scenario_decision` | Scenario branching choice taken |

### Controls

| `kind` | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `pause_clicked` | Sequencer paused |
| `resume_clicked` | Sequencer resumed |
| `exit_clicked` | "Back to home" tapped mid-lesson |
| `replay_clicked` | Scene/act replay tapped |

### Event envelope

Every event accepts the same shape:

```json
{
  "clientEventId": "uuid",
  "kind":          "scene_entered",
  "sessionId":     "lms-canvas-stu-42",
  "lessonId":      "think-before-you-spend",
  "actId":         "act1",
  "sceneId":       "scene-0",
  "activityId":    null,
  "attemptNo":     1,
  "clientTs":      "2026-06-04T12:34:56.789Z",
  "payload":       { "timeMs": 4500 }
}
```

`payload` is a free-form JSONB blob — adding new fields never requires a schema change. The frequently-queried fields (act/scene/activity) are promoted to columns for index-friendly reads.

---

## 5. Database schema

Nine tables created by migration `004_analytics.sql`. You don't need this section to integrate as a consumer — included so you know what's stored.

| Table | One row per | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `analytics_events` | (sessionId, clientEventId) | Append-only ledger. Source of truth. |
| `user_lesson_sessions` | (sessionId, lessonId, attempt) | One row per *attempt*. Re-takes don't overwrite the previous score. |
| `user_act_sessions` | (lessonSession, actId) | Per-act roll-up — points, accuracy, completion. |
| `user_scene_sessions` | (actSession, sceneId) | Per-scene dwell time, interactions, completion. |
| `user_activity_attempts` | each attempt of an activity | Drives "average attempts", "retry rate", "accuracy". |
| `user_scores` | (lessonSession) | Materialised score for fast LMS reads. |
| `user_badges` | (lessonSession, badgeId) | One row per badge earned. |
| `user_attempt_history` | (sessionId, lessonId) | Best/latest/avg roll-up across attempts. |
| `user_learning_progress` | (sessionId) | Cross-lesson cumulative metrics. |

---

## 6. Scoring framework

```
totalScore (0–100) = Σ actScores   (capped at lessonMax = 100)
actScores          = config.acts[actId].max × (points earned / points possible)
learningScore      = 60% accuracy + 25% scenario quality + 15% completion
engagementScore    = 60% completion + 25% interaction density + 15% activity participation
```

**Default per-act distribution**

| Act | Max points | Where points come from |
|---|---|---|
| `act1` | 25 | Scenes (3+5+8+4 = 20 pts) + add-to-cart activities (5 pts) |
| `act2` | 25 | Scenes (4+5+4 = 13 pts) + thought-spiral (8 pts) + flash-cards (4 pts) |
| `act3` | 25 | Scene (5 pts) + s1-pick3 challenge (20 pts) |
| `act4` | 25 | Scene (5 pts) + impulse-meter (8 pts) + takeaways (12 pts) |

**Configurable.** The scoring map lives in [`backend/src/analytics/scoring.js`](../backend/src/analytics/scoring.js) as a single object. When the CMS lands, it loads this map from a database table indexed by `configVersion` — both backend and LMS can fetch the same map.

**Per-activity rules** apply for graded activities (thought-spiral counts correct/total, s1-pick3 applies a 10% retry penalty floored at 30% of max, etc). The materialised `pointsEarned` reflects the result of those rules.

### Score-component meanings (when to use which)

- **`total`** — "Did the student succeed at the lesson?" Use for grading.
- **`learning`** — "How well did they answer?" Use for academic feedback. Reflects *quality* of answers.
- **`engagement`** — "How present were they?" Use for behavioural feedback. A learner can have low `learning` (struggled) but high `engagement` (tried hard, no skips) — that distinction matters for parents.

---

## 7. Badge catalogue

Source of truth: [`backend/src/analytics/badges.js`](../backend/src/analytics/badges.js).

### Score-band badges (exactly one per session — only the highest tier earned)

| `badgeId` | Display name | Earned when | Suggested icon |
|---|---|---|---|
| `master-strategist` | Master Strategist | `total = 100` | 🏆 gold |
| `expert-learner` | Expert Learner | `total ≥ 90` | 🎓 gold |
| `advanced-explorer` | Advanced Explorer | `total ≥ 80` | 🧭 silver |
| `knowledge-builder` | Knowledge Builder | `total ≥ 70` | 📚 silver |
| `emerging-learner` | Emerging Learner | `total ≥ 60` | 🌱 bronze |
| `needs-improvement` | Needs Improvement | `0 < total < 60` | 🔁 neutral |

### Behavioural badges (multiple can stack)

| `badgeId` | Display name | Earned when |
|---|---|---|
| `perfect-act` | Perfect Act | At least one act scored full marks (25/25) |
| `no-skip-champion` | No-Skip Champion | Zero skipped activities across the lesson |
| `fast-finisher` | Fast Finisher | Lesson finished in under 10 minutes |
| `persistence-champion` | Persistence Champion | Retried at least one activity and scored higher on the retry |
| `critical-thinker` | Critical Thinker | Overall accuracy ≥ 90% |
| `decision-master` | Decision Master | Act 3 pick-3 challenge solved perfectly on the first attempt |
| `scenario-specialist` | Scenario Specialist | Both Act 2 mind-trap drag AND Act 3 pick-3 perfect |

### Badge object shape

```json
{
  "badgeId":  "perfect-act",
  "earnedAt": "2026-06-04T10:06:31.000Z",
  "detail":   { "actId": "act2", "points": 25 }
}
```

The `detail` block carries the *why* — e.g. for `perfect-act`, `detail.actId` tells you which act got full marks so you can write "Perfect Act 2" instead of just "Perfect Act".

### UI suggestion

A horizontal strip of pill chips, score-band first (highest visual weight), behavioural chips after. Animate them in with a stagger (~60 ms each) on the parent dashboard for the celebratory feel.

## 8. The report payload (field-by-field)

**The one endpoint that does most of the work:**

```
GET /api/analytics/lms-export/:lessonId?sessionId=<learnerId>
```

Stable contract — schema version `1.0` is frozen. New keys go under `_extras` until promoted in a versioned release.

Full sample response:

```json
{
  "export": {
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "learner":  { "sessionId": "lms-canvas-stu-42" },
    "lesson":   {
      "lessonId":    "think-before-you-spend",
      "attemptNo":   1,
      "completed":   true,
      "startedAt":   "2026-06-04T10:00:00.000Z",

      { "actId":"act4", "title":"Act 4 — Reflect & Realise",           "score":25, "pointsEarned":25, "pointsMax":25, "accuracyPct":null, "completionPct":100, "timeMs":59000  }
    ],
    "improvement": { "previousScore": 72, "currentScore": 97, "deltaScore": 25 },
    "_extras":     { "insights": [
      { "kind": "strongest-act", "message": "Your strongest performance was in Act 2 with 96% accuracy." }
    ]}
  }
}
```

### Headline score block (`.score`)

| Field | Range | Meaning | UI suggestion |
|---|---|---|---|
| `total` | 0–100 | Σ per-act points | Big trophy tile. Color band: ≥90 gold, ≥70 silver, ≥50 bronze, else "needs improvement". |
| `learning` | 0–100 | Quality of answers | Teal accent tile. |
| `engagement` | 0–100 | How present they were | Coral accent tile. |
| `completionPct` | 0–100 | % of scenes completed across all acts | Inline progress bar. |
| `timeMs` | ms | Active time (idle stripped) | Format `Xm Ys`. Footer chip, not headline. |

### Per-act breakdown (`.acts[]`)

| Field | Range | Meaning | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `actId` | `act1`–`act4` | Stable identifier | Chart key |
| `title` | string | Pre-formatted display label | Use directly |
| `score` | 0–25 (default) | Earned points (capped at `pointsMax`) | In-bar number |
| `pointsEarned` | int | Raw numerator | "22 / 25" badge |
| `pointsMax` | int | Raw denominator | |
| `accuracyPct` | 0–100 or `null` | Accuracy for acts that have *gradable* activities. `null` for acts that are pure exposure (Act 1's shopping app, Act 4's self-reflection meter) | Only render chip when non-null |
| `completionPct` | 0–100 | % of scenes in this act completed | Sub-line under bar |
| `timeMs` | ms | Time spent in this act | Inline duration chip |

### Badges (`.badges[]`)

Array of `{ badgeId, earnedAt, detail }` objects. Look up display name in the §7 table. Detail block varies by badge.

### Improvement (`.improvement`)

```json
{
  "previousScore": 72,
  "currentScore":  97,
  "deltaScore":    25
}
```

| Field | Meaning | UI |
|---|---|---|
| `previousScore` | Total from the latest *completed* prior attempt | "Last time: 72" |
| `currentScore` | Total from this attempt | "This time: 97" |
| `deltaScore` | `currentScore − previousScore` (can be negative) | "↑ +25 pts" or "↓ −5 pts". Always with sign. |

If `improvement` is `null`, this is the learner's first completed attempt — skip the block.

### Insights (`._extras.insights[]`)

See §9.

### Lesson metadata (`.lesson`)

| Field | Why |
|---|---|
| `lessonId` | Catalogue id. |
| `attemptNo` | 1-indexed. Show "Attempt 3" badges. |
| `completed` | Toggle in-progress vs finished UI. |
| `startedAt` / `completedAt` | "Started Monday 10am · Finished Monday 10:09am". |

### Learner metadata (`.learner`)

```json
{ "sessionId": "lms-canvas-stu-42" }
```

The `sessionId` is the `?learnerId=` you sent at launch. Use it as the join key against your own student table.

---

## 9. Insights — narrative summary lines

Computed under `_extras.insights[]`. Plain-English, ready to display.

```json
[
  { "kind": "strongest-act",  "message": "Your strongest performance was in Act 2 with 96% accuracy." },
  { "kind": "weakest-act",    "message": "Act 1 could use another pass — accuracy was 56%." },
  { "kind": "time-spent",     "message": "You spent more time in Act 3, indicating deeper engagement." },
  { "kind": "most-retries",   "message": "You retried \"s1-pick3\" 3 times — persistence counts." }
]
```

| `kind` | Always there? | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `strongest-act` | usually | Act with highest accuracy among gradable acts |
| `weakest-act` | conditional | Act with accuracy < 70% |
| `time-spent` | usually | Act the learner spent most time in |
| `most-retries` | conditional | Activity retried 2+ times |

Tone is encouraging, not punitive — designed for parents/students to read directly. Show as bullets or callout cards.

Insights live under `_extras` because the *set* of insights may grow. Top-level `score` / `acts` / `badges` stay stable for v1.0.

## 10. Endpoint reference

Base URL (production): `https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app`
Base URL (local dev): `http://localhost:4000`

All endpoints return `application/json`. Error bodies are `{ "error": "<message>" }` with the appropriate HTTP status. `200` is returned for "no data yet" cases (never `404`).

### 10.1 `GET /api/analytics/lms-export/:lessonId` ⭐ primary

Stable, schemaVersion-1.0 export. **This is the endpoint your LMS uses most.**

| Param | Where | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lessonId` | path | yes | e.g. `think-before-you-spend` |
| `sessionId` | query | yes | The learner id from the launch URL |
| `attempt` | query | no | Specific attempt number. Defaults to latest. |

**Response 200** — see §8 for the full payload.

**Response when learner hasn't started**

```json
{ "export": null }
```

Show "Not yet started" — don't treat as error.

**curl**

```bash
curl 'https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app/api/analytics/lms-export/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=lms-canvas-stu-42'
```

---

### 10.2 `GET /api/analytics/lesson/:lessonId` — richer in-app view

Same data as `lms-export`, plus extras: `report.scenesCount`, `report.attemptsCount`, raw act session row fields. Use this for **live student progress widgets** while they play.

```bash
curl 'https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app/api/analytics/lesson/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=lms-canvas-stu-42'
```

Sample (in-flight):

```json
{
  "report": {
    "sessionId": "lms-canvas-stu-42",
    "lessonId":  "think-before-you-spend",
    "attemptNo": 1,
    "completed": false,
    "totalScore": 47,
    "learningScore": 60,
    "engagementScore": 55,
    "completionPct": 55.55,
    "totalTimeMs": 280000,
    "acts":     [ /* same shape as lms-export */ ],
    "badges":   [ /* badges earned so far */ ],
    "insights": [ /* live insights */ ],
    "improvement": null,
    "scenesCount":   6,
    "attemptsCount": 3
  },
  "storage": "file"
}
```

`completed: false` means the lesson is in flight — poll until it flips to `true`, then fetch `/lms-export/…` for the canonical parent report.

---

### 10.3 `GET /api/analytics/act/:lessonId/:actId` — per-act drill-down

When a parent taps **Act 2** in your dashboard, fetch this for the breakdown.

```bash
curl 'https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app/api/analytics/act/think-before-you-spend/act2?sessionId=lms-canvas-stu-42'
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "report": {
    "actId": "act2",
    "title": "Act 2 — Understanding Impulse Buying",
    "score": 25,
    "pointsEarned": 25,
    "pointsMax":    25,
    "completionPct":100,
    "accuracyPct":  null,
    "timeMs":       149000,
    "scenes": [
      { "sceneId":"scene-6", "completed":true, "skipped":false, "timeMs":28000,  "pointsEarned":4, "interactionCount":12 },
      { "sceneId":"scene-7", "completed":true, "skipped":false, "timeMs":15000,  "pointsEarned":5, "interactionCount":0  },
      { "sceneId":"scene-8", "completed":true, "skipped":false, "timeMs":15000,  "pointsEarned":4, "interactionCount":0  }
    ],

### 10.4 `GET /api/analytics/attempts/:lessonId` — growth over time

```bash
curl 'https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app/api/analytics/attempts/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=lms-canvas-stu-42'
```

```json
{
  "history": {
    "attempts_count":      3,
    "best_score":          97,
    "best_attempt_no":     3,
    "latest_score":        97,
    "latest_attempt_no":   3,
    "avg_score":           82.33,
    "best_completion_pct": 100,
    "total_time_ms":       1820000
  }
}
```

| Field | Use for |
|---|---|
| `attempts_count` | Header chip: "3 attempts" |
| `best_score` | "Best: 97 / 100" |
| `best_attempt_no` | "(on attempt 3)" |
| `latest_score` | Sparkline endpoint |
| `latest_attempt_no` | Pair with latest |
| `avg_score` | Reference line on sparkline |
| `best_completion_pct` | "Always finishes — 100%" if 100 |
| `total_time_ms` | "Total practice: 30m 20s" |

Returns `{ "history": null }` if the learner has never started.

---

### 10.5 `GET /api/analytics/sessions/:lessonId` — list every session

Returns every play of this lesson by this learner, **latest first**. Each item is a mini-report (score, completion, time, badge count) — not the full report tree, just enough for a history strip / leaderboard / "session 3 vs 5" growth chart.

| Param | Where | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `lessonId` | path | yes |
| `sessionId` | query | yes — the learner id from the launch URL |

```bash
curl 'https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app/api/analytics/sessions/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=lms-canvas-stu-42'
```

Sample response:

```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "attemptNo":       3,
      "completed":       true,
      "startedAt":       "2026-06-04T10:00:00.000Z",
      "completedAt":     "2026-06-04T10:08:47.000Z",
      "totalScore":      97,
      "learningScore":   100,
      "engagementScore": 69,
      "completionPct":   100,
      "timeMs":          527000,
      "badgeCount":      7
    },
    {
      "attemptNo":       2,
      "completed":       true,
      "startedAt":       "2026-06-02T18:30:00.000Z",
      "completedAt":     "2026-06-02T18:42:11.000Z",
      "totalScore":      84,
      "learningScore":   72,
      "engagementScore": 81,
      "completionPct":   100,
      "timeMs":          731000,
      "badgeCount":      4
    },
    {
      "attemptNo":       1,
      "completed":       true,
      "startedAt":       "2026-05-30T09:15:00.000Z",
      "completedAt":     "2026-05-30T09:28:42.000Z",
      "totalScore":      72,
      "learningScore":   65,
      "engagementScore": 78,
      "completionPct":   100,
      "timeMs":          822000,
      "badgeCount":      3
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `attemptNo` | 1-indexed session number for this (learner, lesson). |
| `completed` | `true` if `lesson_completed` fired, `false` mid-session or abandoned. |
| `startedAt` / `completedAt` | ISO timestamps. `completedAt` is `null` for in-progress sessions. |
| `totalScore` / `learningScore` / `engagementScore` | 0–100, same semantics as `/lms-export`. |
| `completionPct` | 0–100. |
| `timeMs` | Active time for this session. |
| `badgeCount` | Just the count, not the badge list. Drill into `/lesson?attempt=N` for the full set. |

**To drill into a specific session's full report** pair this list with the existing `/lesson?attempt=N` endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://backend-ten-delta-54.vercel.app/api/analytics/lesson/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=lms-canvas-stu-42&attempt=2'
```

Returns the same full-tree report shape as the default call but for that specific historical attempt.

**Use cases:**

- **Session-history strip** on the report page (the app now shows this automatically once a learner has 2+ sessions).
- **Growth-over-time chart** — `attemptNo` on x-axis, `totalScore` on y-axis.
- **Leaderboard "best of N"** — sort by `totalScore` desc, take row 0.
- **"How long did session 2 take?"** — `timeMs` per attempt.
- **Re-attempt cadence** — `completedAt - startedAt` deltas.

Returns `{ "sessions": [] }` if the learner has never started.

---

### 10.6 `POST /api/analytics/events` — write (internal use)

Used by **our frontend** to ingest events. You won't call this directly unless you're building a tooling integration. Documented here for completeness.

**Body**

```json
{
  "events": [ /* up to 200 event envelopes — see §4 */ ]
}
```

**Response 200**

```json
{ "accepted": 7, "rejected": [], "storage": "file" }
```

Validation failures are reported in `rejected[]`; the rest of the batch lands. A single malformed event can't break a session.

---

### 10.7 Common error responses

| Status | Body | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `{ "error": "sessionId query param required" }` | Missing `sessionId` |
| `200` | `{ "report": null }` or `{ "export": null }` or `{ "history": null }` | Learner hasn't started this lesson — treat as empty state, NOT error |
| `429` | `{ "error": "rate limit" }` | Back off, retry — see §13 |
| `5xx` | `{ "error": "…" }` | Transient — retry with exponential backoff |

---

### Teacher class view

Loop over your roster, hit `/lms-export?sessionId=<their-id>` (or `/lesson` for live state), compose into a table:

| Student | Status | Score | Best | Time | Badges |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aarav | ✓ done | 97 | 97 (#3) | 8m | 🎓 + 6 |
| Priya | ● in progress (Act 3) | 47 | 47 | 6m | — |
| Riya | ○ not started | — | — | — | — |

For class averages, compute server-side in your LMS by summing/averaging across your loop. We don't expose a "class aggregate" endpoint yet — would require knowing your tenant + roster.

---

## 12. Live-progress polling pattern

For the "currently playing" widget, poll `/lesson` every **5–10 seconds** while `report.completed === false`. When it flips to `true`, switch to `/lms-export` for the canonical parent payload.

```
Poll every 5–10s while in flight:
  GET /api/analytics/lesson/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=<id>
  if response.report.completed === true:
      stop polling
      fetch GET /api/analytics/lms-export/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=<id>
      store + render canonical parent report
```

**Polling budget.** Reads are cheap server-side. Poll once every 5 seconds per active learner; the LMS export needs to be called only once when the lesson completes. Per-key rate limit is 60 requests / minute / learner (will be enforced when API-key auth lands).

---

## 13. Authentication, rate limits, edge cases

### Authentication

**Today (pilot):** endpoints are open and keyed only on `sessionId`. Anyone who knows the learner's `sessionId` can read that learner's report. Acceptable for closed-pilot integration.

**Before public launch** we ship API-key auth (~1 week of work once you confirm rollout date):

1. You're issued an `X-Lms-Api-Key` per environment.
2. All read endpoints require:
   ```
   X-Lms-Api-Key: lms_live_…
   X-Lms-Tenant:  canvas        (optional; lets multiple subtenants share a key)
   ```
3. Backend verifies `(apiKey, learnerId)` belongs to your tenant before returning data — a Canvas key can't read a Moodle student.
4. Rate limit per key: 60 requests / minute / learner. Bump on request.

The launch URL stays the same — `learnerId` continues to be sent as a query string. The API key is server-to-server only; never exposed to the browser.

**Future:** LTI 1.3 support on request only (~1–2 weeks of work). Canvas / Moodle / Blackboard native standard.

### Rate limits, retries, caching

- **Reads** are cheap (materialised JSON). Poll the live endpoint up to once every 5 seconds per learner. LMS export only on completion.
- **Retries:** exponential backoff on `5xx` and `429`. We return `Retry-After` in seconds where applicable.
- **Cache headers:** today reads are uncached. When auth lands we'll add per-tenant CDN caching with a 5-second TTL so polling stays cheap at scale.
- **Idempotency:** GETs are pure. POSTs (event ingest, which only we call) are idempotent via client-generated UUIDs.

### Edge cases & defensive rendering

| Case | What the API returns | What you should show |
|---|---|---|
| Learner never started this lesson | `{ "export": null }` | "Not yet started" empty state |
| Learner currently mid-lesson | `lesson.completed: false`, scores reflect progress so far | "In progress" with live values |
| Learner finished but very recently (events still propagating) | Partial fields | Fall back to "Lesson complete — score syncing" copy |
| API 5xx / network error | HTTP 5xx | "Couldn't load — retry" with retry button |
| Field is `null` (e.g. `acts[i].accuracyPct`) | `null` | Don't render the chip / cell — not all acts have accuracy |

All endpoints return `200` for "no data yet" (not `404`). Treat null/empty as a legitimate state, not an error.

---

## 14. Versioning

- `/lms-export` is stamped `schemaVersion: "1.0"`. Top-level keys are stable. New fields go under `_extras` until promoted in a versioned release.
- `/lesson`, `/act`, `/attempts` are richer and *may* evolve — use them for in-app live views, not for storage or contracts. Anything you want to persist on your side, pull from `/lms-export`.
- When we ship schema `1.1`, you'll receive **60+ days of overlap** on both versions plus a changelog entry in this repo's `docs/`.

---

## 15. Contact & support

**`info@leanhyphen.com`** — same-day during pilot integration. When reporting issues please include:

- Exact endpoint URL hit
- `learnerId` used
- Response body (or HTTP status + headers)
- UTC timestamp of the request

That gives us a one-shot path to the event in our log.

---

## 16. Webhooks (intentionally not built yet)

We **don't** push metrics to your LMS today. Every endpoint in §10 is pull-only. This is a deliberate choice for the pilot — webhooks add real complexity (HMAC verification, retry queue, dead-letter handling, idempotency) and most LMS dashboards don't need sub-second push latency. A 30-second polling cadence delivers the same UX for parent reports, transcripts, and growth charts.

### Polling recipe (the "equivalent of webhooks")

| You want to know when… | Poll this | At this cadence |
|---|---|---|
| A learner has *finished* the lesson | `GET /api/analytics/lms-export/:lessonId?sessionId=X` — check if `lesson.completed === true` | Every 30 s while the iframe is open; stop on first `true` |
| A learner just *started* a new attempt | `GET /api/analytics/sessions/:lessonId?sessionId=X` — check the latest `attemptNo` | Every 60 s |
| A learner finished a specific *act* | `GET /api/analytics/lesson/:lessonId?sessionId=X` — check `acts[i].completed` | Every 30 s while active |
| New *badges* earned | `GET /api/analytics/lms-export/:lessonId?sessionId=X` — diff `badges[]` vs your last snapshot | Once after lesson completion is enough |
| Class roster live overview | Loop over all active learners, hit `/lesson` per learner | Every 60 s, stagger requests so you don't hit the rate limit |

### Diff pattern (so polling doesn't double-process)

Most use cases want to fire a downstream action (parent email, gradebook write, notification) **exactly once** per state change. Keep a tiny per-learner snapshot on your side:

```js
// Pseudocode
const last = await db.lastSnapshot(learnerId);  // { completed: bool, attemptNo: N, badges: [...] }
const next = await fetch(`/api/analytics/lms-export/think-before-you-spend?sessionId=${learnerId}`);

if (next.completed && !last.completed) {
  await sendParentEmail(next);             // first-time completion
  await db.markCompleted(learnerId, next);
}
if (next.attemptNo > (last.attemptNo ?? 0)) {
  await db.markNewAttempt(learnerId, next);
}
const newBadges = next.badges.filter((b) => !last.badgeIds.includes(b.badgeId));
if (newBadges.length) await notifyBadges(learnerId, newBadges);

await db.saveSnapshot(learnerId, next);
```

That's the equivalent of webhook handling — with the difference that *you* decide the cadence and don't need to keep a public endpoint up 24/7.

### When we'll add webhooks

We'll build them when a customer LMS explicitly asks for sub-second push. Triggers that would unlock the work:

- A teacher dashboard needs to see "Aarav just finished" inside 1–2 seconds for live class intervention.
- The LMS doesn't run a polling worker and can only accept incoming HTTP.
- Email send-on-completion needs to be sub-30-seconds.

When that happens, the spec is straightforward: HMAC-SHA256 signed POSTs (Stripe / GitHub pattern) on three trigger events — `lesson.completed`, `act.completed`, `lesson.session.started`. The payload for `lesson.completed` will be byte-for-byte identical to today's `GET /lms-export` shape, so you can reuse your parser. Estimated effort: ~1 week including LMS-side handler scaffolding and a verification walkthrough.

### What to tell the LMS engineer

> *"Use the pull endpoints in §10. Poll `/lms-export` every 30 s while a learner is active and once after they log out. Diff against your last snapshot before firing downstream actions. We'll add webhooks only when sub-second latency is a hard requirement."*

If you're hitting that hard requirement now, email **info@leanhyphen.com** and we'll prioritise.
